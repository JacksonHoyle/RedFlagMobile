//This is where all the dependencies I have loaded are displayed. I struggled getting all of them the right version to interact with one another and I'm sure other versions would work but this worked for me
//Specifically I used the react-navigation and this might fail a few dependencies when you try to load it so if it fails, MAKE SURE you install those failed dependencies because if you don't, it messes up everything
